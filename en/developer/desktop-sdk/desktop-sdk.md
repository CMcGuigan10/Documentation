This section is your gateway to important conceptual and technical
information that will help you use the different functions and
functionalities provided by Reveal’s SDK.

### Summary

The following table lists the most common scenarios:

| **Scenario**   | **Details** |
|---|---|
| [**Loading Dashboard Files**](loading-dashboards.md)| To display a dashboard, you must supply an rdash file as stream to the SDK. |    
| [**Configuring the RevealView Object**](configuring-revealview.md)| You can use **RevealView** with **RevealSettings** to show/hide UI elements, specify a dashboard, select global filter values. |
| [**Editing and Saving Dashboards**](editing-saving-dashboards.md)  | After providing the stream containing a dashboard file, you might want to handle a modified dashboard. |
| [**Replacing Data Sources**](replacing-data-sources.md)| You can override the configuration or data to be used for each visualization of the dashboard. |
| [**In-Memory Data Support**](in-memory-data.md) | Data that is part of your application and is already in memory can be used with Reveal SDK. |
